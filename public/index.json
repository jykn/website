During my Postdoc, I used analytic skills learned from my dissertation and specialization in Measurement, Evaluation and Research Methodology at UBC to provide guidance to knowledge users about the reporting and selection of a generic PRO measure for health system planning.\nMy previous life experiences in the Korean army and nursing are chronicled in this book.

Participants will engage in discussion to learn about the concepts of DIF and RS, how to identify DIF and RS relevant to their practice, and different ways to address them using case studies. This discussion will be supplemented with interactive use of polls and survey questions. The contents have been co-developed by research users (clinicians and decision-support analysts).\nBackground: Tools for measuring patients’ perceived health and quality of life such as patient-reported outcomes (or PROs) are increasingly used in clinical practice and decision-making. However, patients may not be consistent in how they interpret and respond to these questions. Differences in the meaning of PROs across patients or over time are known as differential item functioning (DIF) and response shift (RS), respectively. Studies have shown that ignoring DIF and RS could lead to erroneous healthcare decisions.\nAudience benefits: At the end of the webinar, participants will be able to:\n Explain the concepts of DIF and RS and their relevance to their practice setting Critically evaluate and consider different ways to address DIF and RS Facilitate a more accurate assessment of patient outcomes for healthcare decision making  Learning outcomes/objectives: After the webinar, the learner will be able to:\n Understand the concepts of DIF and RS and their implications for healthcare decision-making Identify and address DIF and RS in PRO data  ","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"a83bb10bfe71712327efdbc045daf48c","permalink":"https://jykn.netlify.app/project/msfhr-reach-grant/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/msfhr-reach-grant/","section":"project","summary":"I am a co-PI with Rick Sawatzky (Trinity Western University) in this MSFHR REACH funded project to facilitate wider uptake of knowledge in interpreting PROs for clinical practice.","tags":["Current"],"title":"No one size fits all for measuring what matters: Supporting the use of PRO data in healthcare","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The purpose of this case study is to show how one application of machine learning may support nursing work and to discuss how nurses can contribute to improving its relevance and performance. Using data from 130 specialized hospitals with 101 766 patients with diabetes, we applied various advanced statistical methods (known as machine learning algorithms) to predict early readmission. The best-performing machine learning algorithm showed modest predictive ability with opportunities for improvement. Nurses can contribute to machine learning algorithms by (1) filling data gaps with nursing-relevant data that provide personalized context about the patient, (2) improving data preprocessing techniques, and (3) evaluating potential value in practice. These findings suggest that nurses need to further process the information provided by machine learning and apply \"Wisdom-in-Action\" to make appropriate clinical decisions. Nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring that machine learning algorithms are shaped by their unique knowledge of each patient's personalized context. By combining machine learning with unique nursing knowledge, nurses can provide more visibility to nursing work, advance nursing science, and better individualize patient care. Therefore, to successfully integrate and maximize the benefits of machine learning, nurses must fully participate in its development, implementation, and evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"Nurses \"Seeing Forest for the Trees\" in the age of machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jae-Yung Kwon"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Therefore, we explored theoretical issues, assumptions, and consequences of using PROMs from a philosophical point of view. Our analysis of the literature was informed by Gadamerian hermeneutics, which emphasizes the dialectical processes that occur during interpretation, to provide insights as to how different users interpret and use standardized questions about health and quality of life. We structured our consideration according to three tenets of using PROMs (1) the use of PROMs involves the interpretation of contextual elements (2) interpretation of PROMs is an ongoing dialectical interaction and (3) the use of PROMs involves openness and reflexivity. These findings suggest that hermeneutics provides a useful approach to examining the complexities of measuring patient-reported outcomes by attending to the perspectives of different users (e.g., patients, clinicians, administrators, and policy-makers) at the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels and the broader socio-historical and economic situation. Because PROMs can have different meanings and are used for different purposes, we propose that hermeneutics be used as a lens to ask reflexive questions about the problems of measurement and open a pluralistic dialogue with respect to the way we use PROMs and the interpretations we make of the findings that derive from our studies.","tags":null,"title":"Interpretation and use of patient-reported outcome measures through a philosophical lens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gordana Rajlic","Jae-Yung Kwon","Keren Roded","Anita M.

To improve the operationalization of global self-esteem, the shortcomings of the RSE and of the other measures intended to measure the construct are addressed in the construction of the GSE. Initial psychometric characteristics of the GSE, obtained in a pilot study, are reported. The results of exploratory factor analysis indicated unidimensionality of the measure—a single factor accounted for 78% of the variance in the GSE items, and the magnitude of factor loadings ranged from .81 to .91. Internal consistency reliability was high (ordinal α = .95), and expected relations between the GSE scores and other self-esteem measures were found.

The avoidance of urinary catheterization in the older TAVI population is a strategy to minimize in-hospital complications. The purpose of the study was to explore elimination-related complications following the phased implementation of a default strategy of avoiding urinary catheterization in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVI. We conducted an observational study using a retrospective chart review of patients treated between 2011 and 2013 to identify patient characteristics, peri-procedure details, in-hospital outcomes and elimination-related complications in patients who did or did not receive a peri-procedure indwelling catheter. Descriptive analyses were used to report differences between the groups; we conducted a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the practice of urinary catheterization and total procedure time. Of the 408 patients who underwent TF TAVR, 188 (46.1%) received a peri-procedure indwelling urinary catheter and 220 (53.9%) did not. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality (2.2%), disabling stroke (0.5%), or other major cardiac adverse events. The avoidance of a urinary catheter resulted in significantly lower rates of urinary tract infection requiring a new antibiotic regimen (1.4% versus 6.1%, p = 0.014), haematuria documented by medicine or nursing (3.7% versus 17.6%, p = 0.001), and the need for continuous bladder irrigation (2.7% versus 0%, p = 0.027).","tags":null,"title":"Avoidance of urinary catheterization to minimize in-hospital complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: An observational study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jae-Yung Kwon","Laura Yvonne Bulk","Zarina Giannone","Sarah Liva","Bubli Chakraborty","Helen Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1515628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1515628800,"objectID":"2b72a73ce4c42eaee6619cede068f634","permalink":"https://jykn.netlify.app/publication/peer-review-process/","publishdate":"2018-01-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peer-review-process/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite numerous studies on formal interprofessional education programes, less attention has been focused on informal interprofessional learning opportunities.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the CPRP can be used as an informal interprofessional learning tool using an exploratory qualitative approach. Eight students from Counselling Psychology, Occupational and Physical Therapy, Nursing, and Rehabilitation Sciences were invited to participate in interprofessional focus groups. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. Two key themes emerged, revealing that the CPRP created new opportunities for interprofessional learning and gave practice in negotiating feedback. The results reveal that the CPRP has the potential to be a valuable interprofessional learning tool that can also enhance reviewing and constructive feedback skills.","tags":null,"title":"Collaborative peer review process as an informal interprofessional learning tool: Findings from an exploratory study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jae-Yung Kwon","Richard Sawatzky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499731200,"objectID":"d15264cecdcbd3a71506bbad20c27f81","permalink":"https://jykn.netlify.app/publication/gender-related-dif/","publishdate":"2017-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gender-related-dif/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous research suggests that gender differences in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) may reflect measurement bias rather than true differences in underlying health status.

Between May 2012 and October 2014, the Heart Team developed a clinical pathway suited to the unique requirements of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement in contemporary practice. The components included risk-stratified minimalist periprocedure approach, standardized postprocedure care with early mobilization and reconditioning, and criteria-driven discharge home. Our aim was to reduce variation in care, identify a subgroup of patients suitable for early discharge (≤48 hours), and decrease length of stay for all patients. We addressed barriers related to historical practices, complex multidisciplinary stakeholder engagement, and adoption of length of stay as a quality indicator. We retrospectively reviewed the experiences of 393 consecutive patients; 150 (38.2%) were discharged early. At baseline, early discharge patients had experienced less previous balloon aortic valvuloplasty, had higher left ventricular ejection fraction, better cognitive function, and were less frail than the standard discharge group (48 hours). Early discharge was associated with the use of local anesthesia, implantation of balloon expandable device, avoidance of urinary catheter, and early removal of temporary pacemaker. Median length of stay was 1 day for early discharge and 3 days for other patients; 97.7% were discharged home. There were no differences in 30-day mortality (1.3%), disabling stroke (0.8%), or readmission (10.7%). The implementation of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement clinical pathway shifted the program's approach to combine standardized processes and individual risk stratification. The Vancouver transcatheter aortic valve replacement clinical pathway requires a rigorous assessment to determine its efficacy, safety, and reproducibility.","tags":null,"title":"Vancouver transcatheter aortic valve replacement clinical pathway: Minimalist approach, standardized care, and discharge criteria to reduce length of stay","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jae-Yung Kwon","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

This is because of the complex relationship between social stigma and gender identities (e.g., gay, masculine, HIV+, and smoking status). Inspired to engage HIV-positive gay men in the development of a web-assisted tobacco intervention, we used personas as a main communication tool in our participatory design sessions. Personas are characters created by users that embody part of their own behaviours, thoughts, and motivations. In an apparent paradox, this article is a description of how the use of personas to ensure less realistic self-representation provided an impetus for more self-disclosure. Findings and feedbacks from this study reveal that personas are an effective design tool to engage users in sensitive topics.

The sample consisted of 1,267 adolescents (57% female) in Grades 8 and 9. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the extent to which self-esteem and gender, and their interaction, influenced the odds of having initiated substance use at baseline and at follow-up 6 months later. For each one-point increase on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, there was a reduction in the odds of initiating substance use by up to 9% for tobacco, 3% for alcohol, and 7% for marijuana. The relationships between self-esteem and the initiation of tobacco and alcohol use varied by gender, with boys having slightly less robust associations at the baseline assessment. The results suggest that self-esteem is protective against the initiation of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use.
