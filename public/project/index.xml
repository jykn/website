      <title>Integrating a quality of life assessment and practice support system in homecare</title>
      <link>https://jykn.netlify.app/project/ehipp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am involved in a CIHR-funded study led by Rick Sawatzky (Trinity Western University) to evaluate the impact of an innovative computer tablet-based Quality of life Assessment and Practice Support System (QPSS) in homecare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electronic patient-reported outcomes in clinical kidney practice</title>
      <link>https://jykn.netlify.app/project/epro-kidney/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, my role is to examine the hypothesized intervention effects of PRO workshops by comparing trajectories of outcome measures for patients in the control and intervention site. The analytical objectives are to 1) determine whether provision of ePRO is associated with improved person-centred care, and 2) determine whether education support is associated with improved person-centred outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Response Shift in Sync Working Group</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our historical 3 day in-person meeting took place in &lt;a href=&#34;https://kasteeloudpoelgeest.com/?lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Castle Oud Poelgeest&lt;/a&gt; near Leiden, Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group is led by Mirjam Sprangers (Amsterdam University) and Véronique Sebille (University of Nantes) with four writing team leaders (see full member list &lt;a href=&#34;https://jykn.netlify.app/pdfs/Response%20Shift%20in%20Sync%20Address%20list%20Booklet%20with%20pictures.31-7-2020.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team 1 (Lara Russell)- Empirical evidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team 2 (Nancy Mayo)- Definition and theoretical underpinnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team 3 (Véronique Sébille)- Operationalization/detection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team 4 (Richard Sawatzky)- Implications for decision making&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am part of team 4 to align results of PRO data to patient (micro), the health care organization (meso), and health policy (macro) levels using hermeneutics to gain further insight to consequent implications for decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No one size fits all for measuring what matters: Supporting the use of PRO data in healthcare</title>
      <link>https://jykn.netlify.app/project/msfhr-reach-grant/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We developed a webinar scheduled for early December &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.isoqol.org/education/upcoming-webinars/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ISOQOL&lt;/a&gt; (stay tuned for updates). See below webinar description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring what matters: Enhancing the interpretability of PRO data in healthcare delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical methods (e.g., case examples) to address differential item functioning (DIF) and response shift (RS) will be discussed. Participants will engage in discussion to learn about the concepts of DIF and RS, how to identify DIF and RS relevant to their practice, and different ways to address them using case studies. This discussion will be supplemented with interactive use of polls and survey questions. The contents have been co-developed by research users (clinicians and decision-support analysts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;: Tools for measuring patients’ perceived health and quality of life such as patient-reported outcomes (or PROs) are increasingly used in clinical practice and decision-making. However, patients may not be consistent in how they interpret and respond to these questions. Differences in the meaning of PROs across patients or over time are known as differential item functioning (DIF) and response shift (RS), respectively. Studies have shown that ignoring DIF and RS could lead to erroneous healthcare decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: At the end of the webinar, participants will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain the concepts of DIF and RS and their relevance to their practice setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critically evaluate and consider different ways to address DIF and RS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate a more accurate assessment of patient outcomes for healthcare decision making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning outcomes/objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; 
After the webinar, the learner will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the concepts of DIF and RS and their implications for healthcare decision-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and address DIF and RS in PRO data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
