abstract: Health and quality of life are important treatment goals in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, patterns in patients’ health trajectories over time are not well described. The purpose of this study was to identify health trajectories in outpatients with atrial fibrillation and assess whether variation in their trajectories could be explained by differences in their age, gender, travel distance to the clinic, stroke risk, and when ablation or anticoagulation therapy was received.This was a retrospective analysis of data collected between 2008 and 2016 from a provincial cardiac registry in British Columbia (Canada) and linked with administrative health data. The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life Questionnaire was used to measure health status on repeated visits (up to 10 visits that lasted up to 5 years). Longitudinal latent class models were used to identify latent classes of different health status trajectories while a three-step multinomial logistic regression approach was used to identify predictors. The patients (N = 7,439) were primarily men (61.1%) over 60 years of age (72.9%). Three health status trajectories were identified. The “poor and improving health” class (63.6%) had relatively low baseline scores and gradually improved at each follow-up visit. The “good and stable health” (27.9%) class had higher baseline scores, which remained relatively stable over time. The “excellent and stable health” class (8.5%) had very high baseline scores with little change over time. Relative to the “good and stable health” and “excellent and stable health” classes, people in the “poor and improving health” class were more likely to (a) be less than 60 years in age (versus 76 or older); (b) be women; (c) have higher scores for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk; (d) have had ablation therapy within 6 months to 1 year or more than 2 years after the initial consultation; and (e) have had anticoagulation therapy within 6 months of the initial consultation visit (see corresponding figures).The change in the health trajectories in outpatient settings may be modest at best. Age, gender, stroke risk score, and ablation and anticoagulation therapy at specified follow-up predicted membership in the lowest health trajectory.

summary: This has been awarded the best student poster award at [ISOQOL 2020](https://www.isoqol.org/events/27th-annual-conference/). It is about how the use of growth mixture models can lead to tailoring of subgroup-specific interventions and the enhancement of communication strategies for patients.
