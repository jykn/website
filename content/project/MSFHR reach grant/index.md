We developed a webinar scheduled for early December [ISOQOL](https://www.isoqol.org/education/upcoming-webinars/) (stay tuned for updates). See below webinar description:


**Measuring what matters: Enhancing the interpretability of PRO data in healthcare delivery**  

Practical methods (e.g., case examples) to address differential item functioning (DIF) and response shift (RS) will be discussed. Participants will engage in discussion to learn about the concepts of DIF and RS, how to identify DIF and RS relevant to their practice, and different ways to address them using case studies. This discussion will be supplemented with interactive use of polls and survey questions. The contents have been co-developed by research users (clinicians and decision-support analysts). 

**Background**: Tools for measuring patientsâ€™ perceived health and quality of life such as patient-reported outcomes (or PROs) are increasingly used in clinical practice and decision-making. However, patients may not be consistent in how they interpret and respond to these questions. Differences in the meaning of PROs across patients or over time are known as differential item functioning (DIF) and response shift (RS), respectively. Studies have shown that ignoring DIF and RS could lead to erroneous healthcare decisions.

**Audience benefits**: At the end of the webinar, participants will be able to: 
- Explain the concepts of DIF and RS and their relevance to their practice setting
- Critically evaluate and consider different ways to address DIF and RS
- Facilitate a more accurate assessment of patient outcomes for healthcare decision making

**Learning outcomes/objectives:** 
After the webinar, the learner will be able to:
- Understand the concepts of DIF and RS and their implications for healthcare decision-making 
- Identify and address DIF and RS in PRO data
