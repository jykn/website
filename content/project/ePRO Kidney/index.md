In this project, my role is to examine the hypothesized intervention effects of PRO workshops by comparing trajectories of outcome measures for patients in the control and intervention site. The analytical objectives are to 1) determine whether provision of ePRO is associated with improved person-centred care, and 2) determine whether education support is associated with improved person-centred outcomes.
