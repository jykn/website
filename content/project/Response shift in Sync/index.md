Our historical 3 day in-person meeting took place in [Castle Oud Poelgeest](https://kasteeloudpoelgeest.com/?lang=en) near Leiden, Netherlands. 

The group is led by Mirjam Sprangers (Amsterdam University) and Véronique Sebille (University of Nantes) with four writing team leaders (see full member list {{< staticref "pdfs/Response Shift in Sync Address list Booklet with pictures.31-7-2020.pdf">}}here{{< /staticref >}}):

Team 1 (Lara Russell)- Empirical evidence

Team 2 (Nancy Mayo)- Definition and theoretical underpinnings

Team 3 (Véronique Sébille)- Operationalization/detection

Team 4 (Richard Sawatzky)- Implications for decision making

I am part of team 4 to align results of PRO data to patient (micro), the health care organization (meso), and health policy (macro) levels using hermeneutics to gain further insight to consequent implications for decision making.
