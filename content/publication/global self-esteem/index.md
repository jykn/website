abstract: In the current study, we present the development of the Global Self-Esteem (GSE) measure. The six-item GSE fulfills a need for a short unidimensional measure of global self-esteem conceptualized as “overall positive view of self.” The construct is traditionally measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE); however, several important shortcomings of the scale have been highlighted in the recent research. To improve the operationalization of global self-esteem, the shortcomings of the RSE and of the other measures intended to measure the construct are addressed in the construction of the GSE. Initial psychometric characteristics of the GSE, obtained in a pilot study, are reported. The results of exploratory factor analysis indicated unidimensionality of the measure—a single factor accounted for 78% of the variance in the GSE items, and the magnitude of factor loadings ranged from .81 to .91. Internal consistency reliability was high (ordinal α = .95), and expected relations between the GSE scores and other self-esteem measures were found. The utility of the measure and goals for future research are discussed in the context of limitations of the current study.
