**Teaching Philosophy**

My teaching philosophy is based on the scholarship of appreciative inquiry, which provides a supportive environment for learning by focusing on one's strengths. This philosophy is translated into teaching methods that I developed called the CRC approach, which focuses on three key areas of thinking: critical, reflective and creative (see {{< staticref "https://ln2.sync.com/dl/893f145d0/qmkpgu5t-4hfsn89x-7s4s287p-mfeawk46">}}teaching statement{{< /staticref >}} for details).
