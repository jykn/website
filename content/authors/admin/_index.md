I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Victoria (UVic). My program of research focuses on the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to inform practice and policy. The ultimate goal of my work is to better guide the continuum of analysis, interpretation and action based on PROs to truly support person-centred care. 

Before starting my faculty position at UVic, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Nursing at [TWU](https://twu.ca/academics/school-nursing) and the BC Ministry of Health [Office of Patient-Centred Measurement](https://www.bcpcm.ca/bc-patient-centred-measurement), supported by the [BC SUPPORT Unit](https://bcsupportunit.ca). During my Postdoc, I used analytic skills learned from my [dissertation](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0390462) and specialization in [Measurement, Evaluation and Research Methodology](https://ecps.educ.ubc.ca/measurement-evaluation-and-research-methodology) at UBC to provide guidance to knowledge users about the reporting and selection of a generic PRO measure for health system planning. 

My previous life experiences in the Korean army and nursing are chronicled in this [book](https://www.amazon.ca/Lonely-Bee-Land-Flowers-ebook/dp/B00AVZEEJC). On the side, I enjoy composing relaxing piano music (see my [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCSi45cT6a8K-7SXaSt6SFVA/)).
