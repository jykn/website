I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Victoria (UVic). My program of research focuses on using advanced statistical methods in registry-based patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to inform and guide practice and policy. I also collaborate with research teams to support the continuum of analysis, interpretation and action based on PROs. The ultimate goal of my work is to better analyze and interpret the results of PROs in healthcare to truly support person-centred care. 

Before started my faculty position at UVic, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Nursing at [TWU](https://twu.ca/academics/school-nursing) and the BC Ministry of Health [Office of Patient-Centred Measurement](https://www.bcpcm.ca/bc-patient-centred-measurement), supported by the [BC SUPPORT Unit](https://bcsupportunit.ca). During my Postdoc, I used analytic skills learned from my [dissertation work](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0390462) and specialization in [Measurement, Evaluation and Research Methodology](https://ecps.educ.ubc.ca/measurement-evaluation-and-research-methodology) to provide guidance to knowledge users about the reporting and selection of a generic PRO measure for health system planning. 

You can learn more about my previous life experiences in the Korean army and nursing in this [book](https://www.amazon.ca/Lonely-Bee-Land-Flowers-ebook/dp/B00AVZEEJC). In my spare time, I enjoy composing relaxing piano music (see [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCSi45cT6a8K-7SXaSt6SFVA/)).
