**Advisor Pledge**

Finding “fit” between the supervisor and the student is one of the most important undertakings in graduate education. An {{< staticref "https://ln.sync.com/dl/96a66e8a0/8v29imxm-dpnc5bcd-cumpstyp-sjua9i22">}}advisor pledge{{< /staticref >}} has been created to help understand what you can expect from me (Adapted from {{< staticref "http://theprofessorisin.com/">}}The Professor Is In{{< /staticref >}})


**Available to Supervise**

I am currently looking for graduate students interested in methodological issues using registry-based patient-reported outcomes. These topics include: 
-	Differential item functioning 
-	Moderated mediation analyses
-	Latent variable modelling 
-	Predictive analytics 

Interested candidates should be open to learning R and Mplus (see my publications for fit). If interested, please email me the following:
1.	A 1pg cover letter of your research interest and why there is a good fit
2.	A complete CV (including previous awards, research/work experiences)
3.	Names of 2 referees with official email addresses 

Please note that only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.
