**Advisor Pledge**

Finding “fit” between the supervisor and the student is one of the most important undertakings in graduate education. An {{< staticref "pdfs/Advisor Pledge.pdf">}}advisor pledge{{< /staticref >}} has been created  to provide a shared understanding (based on the book {{< staticref "https://theprofessorisin.com/buy-the-book/">}}The Professor Is In{{< /staticref >}}). 


**Available to Supervise**

I am currently looking for graduate students interested in developing knowledge, interventions, and policy recommendations based on analyses of PROs. These topics include: 
-	Differential item functioning to address equity in measurement 
-	Moderated/mediation analyses to inform interventions focused on improving quality of life
-	Machine learning to predict patients at high risk for poor health outcomes
- Knowledge translation to facilitate use of PROs

Interested candidates should be open to learning R and Mplus (see my publications for fit). If interested, please email me the following:
1. CV
2. 1 page cover letter of research fit and career goal
3. Contact information for 2 references  

Please note that only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.
